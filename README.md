# Medical Condition Prediction from Drug Reviews
This project predicts medical conditions like depression, acne, anxiety, and insomnia based on drug reviews. Using natural language processing (NLP), it cleans and analyzes the text data, then trains a machine learning model (Logistic Regression or Random Forest) to classify reviews and predict the condition based on sentiment and content.

## Technologies Used:
- **Python**: The main programming language used for implementing the project.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Used for processing and analyzing text data from drug reviews.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and training machine learning models (Logistic Regression and Random Forest).
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning, specifically working with datasets.
- **NLTK**: For text processing, including stopword removal and text cleaning.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the text, remove stopwords, and prepare data for model training.
- **TF-IDF Vectorizer**: Converts text data into numerical format for machine learning models.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Train Logistic Regression and Random Forest models to classify drug reviews into health conditions.
- **Prediction**: The model can predict the health condition based on a new user review input.
